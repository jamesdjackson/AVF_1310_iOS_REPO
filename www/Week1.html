        <p>1. Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</p>
        <p>The Twitter developer page gave two great scenarios for using Twitter login. One was for the browser. In this example a “Sign in with
           Twitter” button can appear in page as a button or link. This will either redirect the current page or open a new window to login. Twitter
           then redirects back to the originating URL and passes the user authentication information for the user.
           The second example was almost identical, but optimized for mobile browsers and sessions.
           My only experience with Twitter and payments has been with sites like Amazon that give you the opportunity to tell your Twitter followers
           about your recent purchase after checkout. Something like: ”I just bought 400lbs of cat food for my six cats on @Amazon!”</p>

        <p>2. Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</p>

        <p>JSON-P is essentially a work around to allow an application to retrieve data form an external domain. This would ordinarily be treated as
            a cross domain violation and not be allowed. However, the request is sent as JavaScript and handled in such a way that the data is allowed
            to be retrieved or interpreted as script, rather than parsed as a JSON data set.</p>

        <p>3. Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</p>
        <p>It seems as though mapping and photo data retrieval would be great due to all of the ancillary and often non-standard metadata they both carry.</p>

        <p>4. Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</p>
        <p>I am personally interested in learning about the Instagram API, the mapping/geo API, as well as learning more about implementing the Twitter API.</p>

        <p>5. Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</p>
        <p>I have learned to generally get the skeleton of my projects up and running as early as I can. Much of this has been learning to reuse HTML/CSS
            templates for the CRUDs and try to continue to improve on what I know. I have expanded my professional reading library quite a bit over the last
            or so and I have some great resources I find myself going back to.</p>

        <p>As far as design goes, I read a lot of technology and security (industry) periodicals, blogs and websites. I browse all of the app stores to
            include Google, Apple and the Windows App Stores. I am platform agnostic, and I feel that more so than ever all of the platforms offer something
            for developers and users.</p>
